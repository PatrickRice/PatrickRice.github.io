# GiphyHW
This application utilizes the Giphy API to dynamically create gifs.
Users can click on one of the pre-made buttons available on page load or enter their own request in the input field at the top of the page to dynamically create additional buttons
When a button is clicked, the Giphy API is queried via an AJAX request and ten gifs are loaded on to the page with the button name representing the Giphy API search criteria
The gifs load in the "still" state and switch between "animate" and "still" each time the user clicks the gif
